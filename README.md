# Poker

A Simple poker game

## Requirements

To build the project, you'll need NodeJS, NPM, Yarn and Grunt.

To download the dependencies.

```
npm i -g yarn grunt
yarn install
```

Tested with Node v19.6.0

## Developers

I have replace the old DocPad requirement of the project with Grunt. Check out the [Gruntfile](Gruntfile.coffee) for the latest details.

    grunt watch

Use this task to start up the devlopment environment. Files from `src/` are compiled and output to the `out/` directory. Bring your own web server.

    grunt export

This task will output an optimized final version of the application to the `prod/` directory. The livereload include is automatically stripped from the production version of the application.

## Keyboard Controls

`Enter` to deal/start game, `1-5` to hold.

## Options

There's a panel at the bottom of the inteface you can open. You can activate a score popup feature with this panel.
